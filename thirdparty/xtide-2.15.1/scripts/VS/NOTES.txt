The pre-generated autoconf-defines.h resulted from running configure with
Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 1 and Cygwin as described below.

1.  Do [Windows Logo Thingy Formerly Known as Start Menu] -> All Apps ->
Visual Studio 2015 (folder) -> VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt.  To
prevent file system permissions problems, right click it and run as
Administrator.

2.  Build zlib, libtcd, and libpng as in build.bat.

3.  At the command prompt, execute C:\cygwin64\Cygwin.bat (or substitute the
correct path to your Cygwin.bat file).

4.  Run this, changing version numbers as appropriate:

export LIB="${LIB}..\\zlib;..\\libtcd-2.2.7;..\\libpng-1.6.21;"
export LIBPATH="${LIB}..\\zlib;..\\libtcd-2.2.7;..\\libpng-1.6.21;"
export INCLUDE="${INCLUDE}..\\zlib;..\\libtcd-2.2.7;..\\libpng-1.6.21;"
./configure CC="cl /O2 /MD" CXX="cl /O2 /MD" LD="cl /O2 /MD" CPP="cl /E" LDFLAGS="zlib.lib libpng.lib tcd.lib" --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-semicolon-pathsep --enable-local-files

5.  Copy out the resulting libxtide/autoconf-defines.h and edit as
appropriate.

Running 'make' at this point to attempt to complete the build fails at
linking because of conflicting LDFLAGS needs for xtide.lib versus the tide
executable and the tests in configure:

ar: zlib.lib: No such file or directory
Makefile:628: recipe for target 'libxtide.la' failed
